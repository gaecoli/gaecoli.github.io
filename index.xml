I was a little surprised, because though I’ve gotten that comment before, it’s become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less.</description></item><item><title>How I Learned to Stop Procrastinating, &amp; Love Letting Go</title><link>https://gaecoli.github.io/posts/post-3/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 12:13:32 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://gaecoli.github.io/posts/post-3/</guid><description>The end of procrastination is the art of letting go.
I’ve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.
Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description></item><item><title>Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space</title><link>https://gaecoli.github.io/posts/post-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 12:13:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://gaecoli.github.io/posts/post-2/</guid><description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.
We are afraid of empty space in our lives.
The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description></item><item><title>hahahahahahah</title><link>https://gaecoli.github.io/posts/haha/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://gaecoli.github.io/posts/haha/</guid><description>Pick out the things that need to be done today. Start a Short List for things you’re going to do today. That might be important tasks for big projects, urgent tasks that could result in damage if you don’t act, smaller admin tasks that you really should take care of today, and responding to important messages. I would recommend being ruthless and cutting out as much as you can, having just 5 things on your plate if that’s at all possible.</description></item><item><title>Primer: When You Have Too Much to Do</title><link>https://gaecoli.github.io/posts/post-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://gaecoli.github.io/posts/post-1/</guid><description>You have a to-do list that scrolls on for days. You are managing multiple projects, getting lots of email and messages on different messaging systems, managing finances and personal health habits and so much more.
It all keeps piling up, and it can feel overwhelming.
How do you keep up with it all? How do you find focus and peace and get stuff accomplished when you have too much on your plate?</description></item></channel></rss>
